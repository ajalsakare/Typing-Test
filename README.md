# Typing-Test
<h3>Test your Typing skills</h3>
<br>
I have created a Typing Test application in both GUI(typingtest.py) and CMD Line(main.py) version, which counts the total number of words and characters typed in a minute,
and displays the score based on how many correct words you typed.
<br><br>
New concept which I learned while writing this program is Multiprocessing in python, I was thinking how will I run the timer and the program simultaneously, there must be something 
and googled it and got to know about it, so I created two processes p1 and p2, one runs the typing test and the other one keeps track of time.

Feel free to play with this and I am open to any feedback :)
